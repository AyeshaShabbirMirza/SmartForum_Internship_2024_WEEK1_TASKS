### Week 1 Summary

In Week 1, we explored foundational Python concepts and libraries. We started by experimenting with 20 functionalities of the NumPy library and 20 functionalities of the Pandas library, gaining hands-on experience with array operations and data manipulation. We then used Matplotlib for data visualization to create informative charts and graphs. A practical task involved writing a function to determine whether a given year is a leap year based on specific calendar rules. Finally, we analyzed a dataset of our choice using Pandas, identifying and quantifying missing values to better understand data quality. This week provided a solid foundation in Python programming and data analysis techniques.
